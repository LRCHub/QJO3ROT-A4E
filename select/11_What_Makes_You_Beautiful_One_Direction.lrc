[00:10.56] You're insecure, don't know what for
[00:15.12] You're turning heads when you walk through the door
[00:19.03] Don't need makeup to cover up
[00:22.26] Being the way that you are is enough
[00:40.26] 
[00:26.61] Everyone else in the room can see it
[00:31.01] Everyone else, but you, ooh
[00:44.51] 
[00:33.74] Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
[00:37.10] The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
[00:41.75] But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
[00:45.62] You don't know, oh-oh
[00:48.47] You don't know you're beautiful
[01:03.97] 
[00:50.02] If only you saw what I can see
[00:53.54] You'll understand why I want you so desperately
[00:56.72] Right now I'm lookin' at you, and I can't believe
[01:21.22] 
[01:01.03] You don't know, oh-oh
[01:03.62] You don't know you're beautiful, oh, oh-oh
[01:07.85] That's what makes you beautiful
[01:23.35] 
[01:12.79] So c-come on, you got it wrong
[01:16.41] To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
[01:19.99] I don't know why you're being shy
[01:23.98] And turn away when I look into your eyes
[01:43.98] 
[01:28.75] Everyone else in the room can see it
[01:32.34] Everyone else, but you, ooh
[01:45.84] 
[01:35.90] Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
[01:39.75] The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
[01:43.11] But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell

[02:02.78] You don't know, oh-oh
[02:05.85] You don't know you're beautiful, oh, oh-oh
[02:09.08] That's what makes you beautiful
[02:24.58]
